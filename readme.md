## Supermetric Analytics API Consumer
 
> This project provides basic statistics of posts made on social
> media (supermetrics), To consume to this code one requires credentials
> provided by supermetrics

>Example Credentials are in `supermetric_credentials.php`

```php
return [
    'client_id' => 'client Id provided by supermetric',
    'email'     => 'email@supermetrics.com',
    'name'      => 'Demo Client'
];
```

### Installation and running of application

> Environment : `PHP=^8.0`

##### Steps to run the application

```shell
git clone gitURL
cd supermetrics
composer install
```
> Running the script
```shell
php consumer.php
```

> Once the scripts run successfully, you would see output like

```json
{
    "avg_char_length_post_per_month": {
        "February": 403,
        "January": 399
    },
    "longest_post_per_month": {

    },
    "avg_post_per_user_per_month": {
        "user_17": 7,
        "user_11": 8

### Technical Description and arguments on the design concept

> Dependency and Library used

```
"guzzlehttp/guzzle": "^7.3",
"nesbot/carbon": "^2.46"

### Design of the application

ðŸ“¦supermetrics
â”£ ðŸ“‚.github
â”£ ðŸ“‚.idea
â”£ ðŸ“‚ supermtric-sdk
â”ƒ    â”£ ðŸ“œ Authenticate.php

```

`consumer.php` is main file and supermetric-sdk is written as a library which 
anyone can include in their project and use these stats methods to get stats

1. `Authenticate.php` as it says handles the methods to authenticate using the
provided credentials and get the SL Token  for further requests
   
2. `SocialAnalytics.php` contains two methods. One method to get al the posts
and second method to basically calculate the stats from those post.
   >a. As in the task document it provided maximum page can be 10.
   > 
   >b. Assumed that while calculating stats there is no importance of the `year`
   as it was not mentioned anywhere

### Dependency and their usage reason

>`guzzlehttp/guzzle`: This library provides a lot of functionality for doing http request
> One can directly use the CURL provided by PHP but that wouyld be re-inventing the wheel.
> It also provides pool and concurrent request options which I have utilized to improve the performance

> `nesbot/carbon"`: This library provides a lot of functionality and features related to 
> date which I didn't require. But the small thing which I required to do with date, I have used carbon for that
